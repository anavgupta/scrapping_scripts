Question:
Given 2 int arrays, a and b, return a new array length 2 containing, as much as will fit, the elements from a followed by the elements from b. The arrays may be any length, including 0, but there will be 2 or more elements available between the 2 arrays.

Use Cases:
make2([4, 5], [1, 2, 3]) → [4, 5]
make2([4], [1, 2, 3]) → [4, 1]
make2([], [1, 2]) → [1, 2]
