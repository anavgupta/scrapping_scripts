Question:
Given a list of strings, return a list where each string has "y" added at its end, omitting any resulting strings that contain "yy" as a substring anywhere.

Use Cases:
noYY(["a", "b", "c"]) → ["ay", "by", "cy"]
noYY(["a", "b", "cy"]) → ["ay", "by"]
noYY(["xx", "ya", "zz"]) → ["xxy", "yay", "zzy"]
