Question:
Given a string, if a length 2 substring appears at both its beginning and end, return a string without the substring at the beginning, so "HelloHe" yields "lloHe". The substring may overlap with itself, so "Hi" yields "". Otherwise, return the original string unchanged.

Use Cases:
without2("HelloHe") → "lloHe"
without2("HelloHi") → "HelloHi"
without2("Hi") → ""
