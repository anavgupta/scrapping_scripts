Question:
Given a string, return true if "bad" appears starting at index 0 or 1 in the string, such as with "badxxx" or "xbadxx" but not "xxbadxx". The string may be any length, including 0. Note: use .equals() to compare 2 strings.

Use Cases:
hasBad("badxx") → true
hasBad("xbadxx") → true
hasBad("xxbadxx") → false
