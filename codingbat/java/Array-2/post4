Question:
Given a non-empty array of ints, return a new array containing the elements from the original array that come after the last 4 in the original array. The original array will contain at least one 4. Note that it is valid in java to create an array of length 0.

Use Cases:
post4([2, 4, 1, 2]) → [1, 2]
post4([4, 1, 4, 2]) → [2]
post4([4, 4, 1, 2, 3]) → [1, 2, 3]
