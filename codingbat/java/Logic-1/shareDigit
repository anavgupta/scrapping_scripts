Question:
Given two ints, each in the range 10..99, return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as the 2 in 12 and 23. (Note: division, e.g. n/10, gives the left digit while the % "mod" n%10 gives the right digit.)

Use Cases:
shareDigit(12, 23) → true
shareDigit(12, 43) → false
shareDigit(12, 44) → false
