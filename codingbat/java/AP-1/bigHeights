Question:
(A variation on the sumHeights problem.) We have an array of heights, representing the altitude along a walking trail. Given start/end indexes into the array, return the number of "big" steps for a walk starting at the start index and ending at the end index. We'll say that  step is big if it is 5 or more up or down. The start end end index will both be valid indexes into the array with start <= end.

Use Cases:
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 2, 4) → 1
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 1) → 0
bigHeights([5, 3, 6, 7, 2], 0, 4) → 1
