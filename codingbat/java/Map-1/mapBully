Question:
Modify and return the given map as follows: if the key "a" has a value, set the key "b" to have that value, and set the key "a" to have the value "". Basically "b" is a bully, taking the value and replacing it with the empty string.

Use Cases:
mapBully({"a": "candy", "b": "dirt"}) → {"a": "", "b": "candy"}
mapBully({"a": "candy"}) → {"a": "", "b": "candy"}
mapBully({"a": "candy", "b": "carrot", "c": "meh"}) → {"a": "", "b": "candy", "c": "meh"}
