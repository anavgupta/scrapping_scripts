Question:
Given two arrays of ints sorted in increasing order, outer and inner, return true if all of the numbers in inner appear in outer. The best solution makes only a single "linear" pass of both arrays, taking advantage of the fact that both arrays are already in sorted order.

Use Cases:
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 6], [2, 3, 4]) → false
linearIn([1, 2, 4, 4, 6], [2, 4]) → true
