Question:
Given three ints, a b c, return True if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

Use Cases:
close_far(1, 2, 10) → True
close_far(1, 2, 3) → False
close_far(4, 1, 3) → True
